Title: GSOC 2025 - Produce Routing Engine for spopt
---

On this blog, I will regularly document my progress on the `spopt` routing engine project. The purpose of these posts will be to document specific issues encountered and the strategies employed to address them. The most useful aspect of this blog will be to retain information about specific packages that I will need to become familiar with in order to complete the project. In a way, these posts will resemble notes that I might take for a class (with just a touch more editing/formatting, of course). I created this blog using a useful [github-pages tutorial repository](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). The readme.md in the user's fork of this repository dynamically updates as individual tasks are completed, which ultimately results in the user learning about how to generate a github-pages webpage with Jekyll. What a cool pedagogical tool for the amatuer code manager!
